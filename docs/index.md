# Introduction

## Overview

This application slices a 3D model (STL file) into layers and generates SVG files for each layer, including reference
marks for reassembly.

## Project Goals

1. Adhere to the functional requirements.
2. Implement the application in Python.
3. Bundle the application and its dependencies into a single executable.
4. Ensure the executable runs on different platforms without requiring a Python installation.
5. Utilize Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and Separation of Concerns (SoC) in the design.
6. Implement a clean and maintainable codebase.
7. Provide clear documentation for the application's functionality and development process.
